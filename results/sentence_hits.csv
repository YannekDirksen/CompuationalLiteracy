12,"THE GOLDEN BIRD


A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree
which bore golden apples.",0,0,,,0
13,"These apples were always counted, and about
the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one
of them was gone.",0,0,,,0
14,"The king became very angry at this, and ordered the
gardener to keep watch all night under the tree.",0,0,,,0
15,"The gardener set his
eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in
the morning another of the apples was missing.",0,1,,fall,1
16,"Then the second son was
ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning
another apple was gone.",0,1,,fall,1
17,"Then the third son offered to keep watch; but
the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come
to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself
under the tree to watch.",0,0,,,0
18,"As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling
noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as
it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son
jumped up and shot an arrow at it.",0,0,,,0
19,"But the arrow did the bird no harm;
only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.",0,0,,,0
20,"The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the
council was called together.",0,0,,,0
21,"Everyone agreed that it was worth more than
all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no
use to me, I must have the whole bird.’",0,0,,,0
22,"Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden
bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a
wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his
bow and made ready to shoot at it.",1,0,take,,1
23,"Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,
for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and
that you want to find the golden bird.",0,0,,,0
24,"You will reach a village in the
evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each
other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in
there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you
to be very poor and mean.’",0,0,,,0
25,"But the son thought to himself, ‘What can
such a beast as this know about the matter?’",0,0,,,0
26,"So he shot his arrow at
the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and
ran into the wood.",0,0,,,0
27,"Then he went his way, and in the evening came to
the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people
singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,
and poor.",0,0,,,0
28,"‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby
house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,
and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.",1,1,eat,eat,1
29,"Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings
were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened
to him.",0,0,,,0
30,"He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came
to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where
the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not
withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and
his country in the same manner.",0,0,,,0
31,"Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into
the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not
listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and
was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his
coming back.",0,0,,,0
32,"However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would
not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard
the same good counsel.",0,0,,,0
33,"But he was thankful to the fox, and did not
attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my
tail, and you will travel faster.’",0,0,,,0
34,"So he sat down, and the fox began to
run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair
whistled in the wind.",0,0,,,0
35,"When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and
without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all
night at his ease.",0,0,,,0
36,"In the morning came the fox again and met him as he
was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come
to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and
snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and
on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;
close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the
bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise
you will repent it.’",2,0,take take,,1
37,"Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the
young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till
their hair whistled in the wind.",0,0,,,0
38,"Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in
and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and
below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been
lost were lying close by it.",0,1,,hang,1
39,"Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a
very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so
he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.",1,0,take,,1
40,"But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and
they took him prisoner and carried him before the king.",1,0,take,,1
41,"The next morning
the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to
die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as
swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird
given him for his own.",0,1,,die,1
42,"So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,
when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now
what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel.",0,0,,,0
43,"I will
still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as
I bid you.",0,0,,,0
44,"You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the
horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep
and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old
leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’",1,0,take,,1
45,"Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.",0,0,,,0
46,"All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden
saddle.",0,0,,,0
47,"But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity
to put the leathern saddle upon it.",0,0,,,0
48,"‘I will give him the good one,’
said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’",0,0,,,0
49,"As he took up the golden saddle the
groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took
him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court
to be judged, and was sentenced to die.",2,1,take take,die,1
50,"But it was agreed, that, if he
could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the
bird and the horse given him for his own.",0,0,,,0
51,"Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why
did not you listen to me?",0,0,,,0
52,"If you had, you would have carried away
both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel.",0,0,,,0
53,"Go
straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle.",0,0,,,0
54,"At twelve
o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her
and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care
you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’",3,0,lead take take,,1
55,"Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled again.",0,0,,,0
56,"As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve
o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the
kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears
that he would let her take leave of her father.",1,0,take,,1
57,"At first he refused,
but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last
he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards
awoke and he was taken prisoner again.",2,1,refuse take,fall,1
58,"Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never
have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops
the view from my window.’",0,0,,,0
59,"Now this hill was so big that the whole world
could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had
done very little, the fox came and said.",1,0,take,,1
60,"‘Lie down and go to sleep; I
will work for you.’",0,0,,,0
61,"And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;
so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was
removed he must give him the princess.",0,0,,,0
62,"Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man
and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all
three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’",0,0,,,0
63,"‘Ah!’ said the young man,
‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’

‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done.",0,0,,,0
64,"When you come
to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here
she is!”",0,0,,,0
65,"Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden
horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of
them; but shake hands with the princess last.",1,0,take,,1
66,"Then lift her quickly on
to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as
fast as you can.’

All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where
the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will
ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right
horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that
you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and
when you get it into your hand, ride away.’",0,0,,,0
67,"This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the
princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood.",0,0,,,0
68,"Then the fox
came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’",2,1,kill cut,cut,1
69,"But the
young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give
you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,
and sit down by the side of no river.’",1,0,refuse,,1
70,Then away he went.,0,0,,,0
71,"‘Well,’
thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’",0,0,,,0
72,"He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where
he had left his two brothers.",0,0,,,0
73,"And there he heard a great noise and
uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men
are going to be hanged.’",0,1,,hang,1
74,"As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were
his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any
way be saved?’",0,1,,turn,1
75,"But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his
money upon the rascals and buy their liberty.",0,0,,,0
76,"Then he did not stay to
think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were
given up, and went on with him towards their home.",0,0,,,0
77,"And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so
cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the
side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’",1,1,eat,eat,1
78,"So he said,
‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the
river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him
down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went
home to the king their master, and said.",2,1,throw take,throw,1
79,"‘All this have we won by our
labour.’",0,0,,,0
80,"Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not
eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.",1,1,eat,eat,1
81,"The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was
nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep
that he could find no way to get out.",0,1,,fall,1
82,"Then the old fox came once more,
and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would
have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold
of my tail and hold fast.’",0,0,,,0
83,"Then he pulled him out of the river, and said
to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill
you, if they find you in the kingdom.’",1,0,kill,,1
84,"So he dressed himself as a poor
man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the
doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess
left off weeping.",1,1,eat,eat,1
85,"Then he went to the king, and told him all his
brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the
princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to
his kingdom.",1,0,seize,,1
86,"A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox
met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut
off his head and feet.",2,1,kill cut,cut,1
87,"And at last he did so, and in a moment the
fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the
princess, who had been lost a great many many years.",0,1,,turn,1
88,"HANS IN LUCK


Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes
right--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are
swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they
will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so
much the faster.",0,1,,fall,1

they think of themselves, but what care they for the world?",0,0,,,0

know about the matter?",0,0,,,0

92,"Seven long years he had
worked hard for his master.",0,0,,,0

must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages
and let me go.’",0,0,,,0
94,"And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good
servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’",0,0,,,0
95,"Then he gave him a lump
of silver as big as his head.",0,0,,,0
96,"Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,
threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards.",2,1,take throw,throw,1
97,"As he
went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,
trotting gaily along on a capital horse.",0,0,,,0
98,"‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a
fine thing it is to ride on horseback!",0,0,,,0
99,"There he sits as easy and happy
as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no
stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’",0,0,,,0
100,"Hans did
not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,
friend, why do you go on foot then?’",0,0,,,0
101,"‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to
carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up
my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’",0,0,,,0
102,"‘What do you say
of making an exchange?’ said the horseman.",0,0,,,0
103,"‘I will give you my horse,
and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of
trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’",0,0,,,0
104,"‘With all my
heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one
thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’",0,0,,,0
105,"However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him
the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When
you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry
“Jip!”’

Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his
elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one
minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,

 ‘No care and no sorrow,
  A fig for the morrow!",1,1,take,turn,1

smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’",0,0,,,0

before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his
back by the road-side.",1,1,throw,throw,1
109,"His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who
was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it.",0,0,,,0
110,"Hans soon came to
himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the
shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon
a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break
his neck.",0,0,,,0
111,"However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great
deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has
spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells
not very like a nosegay.",0,0,,,0
112,"One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that
cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,
into the bargain.",0,0,,,0
113,What would I give to have such a prize!’,0,0,,,0
114,"‘Well,’ said
the shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your
horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it
myself.’",0,0,,,0

116,"‘What a noble heart that good man
has!’ thought he.",0,0,,,0

and the cow good morning, and away he rode.",0,0,,,0

then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky
one.",0,0,,,0

able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with
it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what
can I wish for more?’",1,1,eat,eat,1

bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer.",1,1,eat,eat,1

rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s
village.",0,0,,,0

last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than
an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue
clave to the roof of his mouth.",1,0,take,,1
123,"‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought
he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the
stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop
was to be had.",0,0,,,0

him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry?",0,0,,,0

not thought of looking to that.",0,0,,,0

clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at
last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he
lay a long while senseless.",0,0,,,0

pig in a wheelbarrow.",0,0,,,0

butcher, as he helped him up.",0,0,,,0

was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too.",0,0,,,0

the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh
yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old
beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’",0,0,,,0

pig for the cow.’",0,0,,,0

wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to
its leg.",1,0,take,,1

with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.",0,0,,,0

There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close
by the seaside.",0,0,,,0
498,"The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and
one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling
waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away
deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.",0,0,,,0

enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’",0,0,,,0

said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will
have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon
as you please!’",0,0,,,0
502,"Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted
straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him
on the wave.",0,0,,,0
503,"When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how
he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted
prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again.",0,0,,,0
504,"‘Did not
you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,
in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug
little cottage.’",0,0,,,0
505,"The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the
seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and
green.",0,0,,,0
506,"And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:

 ‘O man of the sea!",0,0,,,0
507,Hearken to me!,0,0,,,0
508,"My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’",0,0,,,0
509,"Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?",0,0,,,0
510,What does your wife want?’,0,0,,,0
511,"‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when
I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let
you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants
a snug little cottage.’",0,0,,,0
512,"‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the
cottage already!’",0,0,,,0

door of a nice trim little cottage.",0,0,,,0

515,"said she; ‘is
not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’",0,0,,,0

parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there
was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and
there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens.",0,0,,,0
517,"‘Ah!’ said the
fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’",0,0,,,0
518,"‘We will try to do so, at
least,’ said his wife.",0,0,,,0
519,"Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,
‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the
courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to
have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him
to give us a castle.’",0,0,,,0
520,"‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to
him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this
pretty cottage to live in.’",0,0,,,0
521,"‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it
very willingly, I know; go along and try!’",0,0,,,0
522,"The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to
the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went
close to the edge of the waves, and said:

 ‘O man of the sea!",0,0,,,0
523,Hearken to me!,0,0,,,0
524,"My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,

528,"So away went
the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great
castle.",0,0,,,0
529,"‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’",0,0,,,0
530,"With that they went into
the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the
rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and
behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a
mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the
courtyard were stables and cow-houses.",0,0,,,0
531,"‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we
will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of
our lives.’",0,0,,,0
532,"‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,
before we make up our minds to that.’",0,0,,,0
533,So they went to bed.,0,0,,,0
534,"The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and
she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,
and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’",0,0,,,0

said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king?",0,0,,,0
536,I will not be king.’,0,0,,,0

538,"‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you
be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’",0,0,,,0
539,"‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say
no more about it, but go and try!",0,0,,,0
540,I will be king.’,0,0,,,0

quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king.",0,0,,,0
542,"This time
the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves

man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’",0,0,,,0
547,"‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king
already.’",0,0,,,0
548,"Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw
a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets.",0,0,,,0
549,"And when
he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,
with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six
fair maidens, each a head taller than the other.",0,0,,,0
550,"‘Well, wife,’ said the
fisherman, ‘are you king?’",0,0,,,0
551,"‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’",0,0,,,0
552,"And when he had
looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife!",0,0,,,0
553,"what a fine thing it
is to be king!",0,0,,,0
554,"Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long
as we live.’",0,0,,,0
555,"‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long
time.",0,0,,,0

think I should like to be emperor.’",0,0,,,0
557,"‘Alas, wife!",0,0,,,0
558,"why should you wish to
be emperor?’ said the fisherman.",0,0,,,0
559,"‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!",0,0,,,0
560,I say I will be emperor.’,0,0,,,0
561,"‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish
cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for
such a thing.’",0,0,,,0
562,"‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go
at once!’",0,0,,,0
563,"So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,
‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be
tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’",1,0,force,,1
564,"He
soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and
a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he
went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:

 ‘O man of the sea!",0,0,,,0
565,Hearken to me!,0,0,,,0
566,"My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,

568,"‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,
‘she wants to be emperor.’",0,0,,,0
569,"‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor
already.’",0,0,,,0
570,"So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill
sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on
her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards
and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the
tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger.",0,0,,,0
571,"And
before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went
up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’",0,0,,,0
572,"‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am
emperor.’",0,0,,,0
573,"‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing
it is to be emperor!’",0,0,,,0
574,"‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being
emperor?",0,0,,,0
575,I will be pope next.’,0,0,,,0

pope?",0,0,,,0
577,there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’,0,0,,,0

she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’",0,0,,,0

fish cannot make you pope.’",0,0,,,0

an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’",0,0,,,0
581,So the fisherman went.,0,0,,,0

and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were
in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows.",0,0,,,0

middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards
the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising.",0,0,,,0

around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church.",0,0,,,0

you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’",0,0,,,0

was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose.",0,0,,,0

the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks
shook.",0,0,,,0

lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in
the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of

how to fly.",0,0,,,0

soon learn how to shudder.’",0,0,,,0

your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’",0,0,,,0

their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as
these should never see the daylight again.’",0,0,,,0

this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’",0,0,,,0

no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a
haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,
if he would but watch in it for three nights.",0,0,,,0

he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the
most beautiful maiden the sun shone on.",0,0,,,0

treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would
then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough.",0,0,,,0

had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again.",0,0,,,0

youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will
willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’",0,0,,,0

ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must
be things without life.’",1,0,take,,1

turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’",0,1,,turn,1

day.",0,0,,,0

a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife
beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe.",0,0,,,0

but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’",0,0,,,0

midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,

that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down
on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery
eyes.",0,0,,,0

‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’",0,0,,,0

just show me your paws.’",0,0,,,0

he, ‘what long nails you have!",0,0,,,0

threw them out into the water.",1,1,throw,throw,1

and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and

horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put
it out.",0,0,,,0

going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,

looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.",0,0,,,0

for me,’ said he, and got into it.",0,0,,,0

eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over
the whole of the castle.",0,0,,,0

the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,
over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside
down, and lay on him like a mountain.",0,1,,turn,1

in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and
lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day.",1,1,throw,throw,1

came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil
spirits had killed him and he was dead.",1,0,kill,,1

pity,--for so handsome a man.’",0,0,,,0

has not come to that yet.’",0,0,,,0

and asked how he had fared.",0,0,,,0
3772,"‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one
night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’",0,0,,,0

innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to
see you alive again!",0,0,,,0

fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’",0,0,,,0

midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at
first it was low, but it grew louder and louder.",0,0,,,0

a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the
chimney and fell before him.",0,1,,fall,1

roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise.",0,1,,fall,1

brought a coffin.",0,0,,,0

KING GRISLY-BEARD


A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.",0,0,,,0
3853,"Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights.",0,0,,,0
3854,"Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one.",0,0,,,0
3855,"The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she.",0,0,,,0
3856,"The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she.",0,0,,,0
3857,The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’,0,0,,,0
3858,said she.,0,0,,,0
3859,"The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’",0,0,,,0
3860,"The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’",0,0,,,0
3861,"The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven.",0,0,,,0
3862,"And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there.",0,0,,,0
3863,"‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’",0,0,,,0
3864,So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.,0,0,,,0
3865,"But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.",0,0,,,0
3866,"Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’",0,0,,,0
3867,"So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon.",0,0,,,0
3868,"Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’",0,0,,,0

sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’",0,0,,,0

and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler.",0,0,,,0
3871,"When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’",0,0,,,0

to a great wood.",1,0,take,,1

to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’",1,0,take,,1
